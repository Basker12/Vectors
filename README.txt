Here you have all the vector operations,
all of these are coded without using
the Numpy libary. All of these are 
'hard coded', this may be usefull for 
an exam or if your trying to find a
job and they might ask you to all of
these operations revolving around vectors
without the help of a libary e.g. Numpy

Here are the four operations: 

1: Adding and subtracting vectors

2: Convex of two vectors

3: Dot product of vectors

4: Multiplying vectors and scalars
